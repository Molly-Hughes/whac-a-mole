# [WHAC A MOLE](https://youtu.be/ej8SatOj3V4)

- Original Coding Tutorial: https://youtu.be/ej8SatOj3V4
- Demo: https://imkennyyip.github.io/whac-a-mole/

This project is a Mario-themed Whac-A-Mole game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I followed Kenny Yip's tutorial to create this game and learned how to:

- Use HTML5 Canvas to render the game board.
- Manipulate DOM elements to set up the game.
- Add event listeners for player interactions.
- Randomly spawn moles and piranha plants.

I made some modifications to personalise the project, but the core structure follows the tutorial. Huge thanks to Kenny Yip Coding for the original guide! ðŸŽ®
